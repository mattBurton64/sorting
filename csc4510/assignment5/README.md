# Assignment 5
Write two programs in a functional language (Haskell). One should be simple and the other should be more advanced. 


## Usage

To run the two Haskell programs execute
```
runghc functional/Simple.hs
```
and
```
runghc functional/Advanced.hs
```
To use the doubleMe function from Simple.hs, first enter GHC
```
ghci
```
Next load the program
```
:l Simple.hs
```
Finally, execute the program by enter the number you want to double after the program, separated by a space
```
doubleMe 2
```

## Output
After running the two Haskell programs you should expect to see
```
hello world
```
and
```
1 2 bizzbizz 4 5 bizz buzzbuzz 8 bizz 10 11 bizz bizz buzz bizz 16 buzz bizz 19
```

After running the doubleMe function you should see
```
4
```
