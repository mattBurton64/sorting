README

2 programs are provided to illustrate a complete working compiler, including code generation. Note you are not asked to implement code generation as part of your project.

To compile a program (prog.lille is the name of the project to be compiled in these examples):
./compiler prog.lille	# Generates proj.pal if there are no errors

./compiler -h		# help flag shows all flags that can be used with the compiler
Valid flags are:
	-h		help
	-l		create a listing (.lis) file
	-o  filename	create an output code file with a specified filename. 

To execute the generated pal code:
./pal			# tries to execute the pal code found in a file named CODE
./pal prog.pal		# tries to execure the pal code found in the file named prog.pal

./pal -h		# help flag shows all flags that can be used with the interpreter.
Valid flags are:
	-h		help
	-l		Create a listing file to standard output showing he PAL code and memory
			Stack contents during the execution process.
