# PHY-2200 Computational Physics (4 Credits)

A project-based introduction to computational physics through computational modeling. Students will learn to construct, solve, validate, and communicate mathematical models of physical systems. Topics include numerical techniques for solving ordinary and partial differential equations, data analysis, error analysis, and parallel computing. Applications of modeling across a variety of areas, including statistical mechanics, fluid dynamics, and non-linear dynamics, will be explored.
