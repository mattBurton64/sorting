      <h1>Good and Bad Web Design</h1>
	      <p>
	        In this assignment we will be looking at more examples of good and bad web design.  To see more examples of good web design, please vist
	        <a href="http://www.smashingmagazine.com/web-design-essentials-examples-and-best-practices/">Smashing Magazines examples of good design</a>
	        .  You should read the pages there on best practices.  Look at the examples there and pick 5 examples from the site or anywhere else of Web sites where you like the design.
	        I want you to present the pages you like and a description of a minimum of three reasons why you like them in the following format: 
	      </p>

      <h1>The Good</h1>
<!--        <h2>Example of Web Page With Good Design</h2>
          <a href="http://www.apple.com">Apple Computers</a>
          <p>
            I like this site, because it is simple and balanced.  I like the fact that the designer was not afraid to use a lot of white space on the main page.  I uses a basic color palate consistently throughout the entire site.  
            I like the fact that the home page has only a few links to very logical categories.  Even though there are only a few links on this 
homepage, you are only a few clicks from most things you would want to find on the site.
          </p>
-->
      <h2>First Example of Web Page With Good Design</h2>
        <a href="https://www.adobe.com/">Adobe</a>
        <p>Adboe utilizes color to effectively draw the user in and compliment their expressive design philosophies. Additionally, adobe presents the user with a robust navigation bar to link to most pages in minimal clicks. Finally, the footer includes links to all Adobe resources to comply with ADA.</p>
      <h2>Second Example of Web Page With Good Design</h2>
        <a href="https://www.spotify.com/us"/>Spotify</a>
        <p>Spotify utilizes their index page as a landing page prompting the user to download the app. Additionally, the color scheme is  simple and provides effective contrast. Finally, the navigation bar is consise as to not overwhel any users.</p>
      <h2>Third Example of Web Page With Good Design</h2>
        <a href="https://soundcloud.com/discover">Soundcloud</a>
        <p>Soundcloud effectively delivers new music tailored to the users listening history right as they enter the site. The color scheme is simple and orange pops well against both black and white. Containers help group playlists of content, minimizes the space consumed and maximizing the content provided. </p>
<!--      <h2>Fourth Example of Web Page With Good Design</h2>
        <a href=""></a>
        <p>Place a link and paragraph description of why you like the Web site here.  You must give at least three reasons! </p>
      <h2>Fifth Example of Web Page With Good Design</h2>
        <a href=""></a>
        <p>Place a link and paragraph description of why you like the Web site here.  You must give at least three reasons! </p>

      <h1>The Bad and the Ugly</h1>
        <p>For this part of the assignment, I want you to do the same thing you did for the first part, but instead
        of what you like, you will be describing what you don't like.  You must include at least three reasons that the site 
        you don't like has bad design.  You can find many examples of bad design on this 
        <a href="https://blog.rankingbyseo.com/bad-websites/">list of the top 50 worst Web sites</a>
        .
        </p>

      <h2>First Example of Web Page With Bad Design</h2>
        <a href="http://linus.highpoint.edu/~mburton/test/index.html">My Web Page</a>
        <p>My website exhibits bad design because its incomplete, lacking any substantial media or information. The website colors could compliment and contrast each other more effectively. The website lacks any elements of visual interest, to help build a cohesive look. </p>
      <h2>Second Example of Web Page With Bad Design</h2>
        <a href="https://www.yahoo.com/">Yahoo</a>
        <p>Yahoo struggles to minimize its purpose to provide clear usefulness. The home page is overwhelming with a search, many navigation options, and news all competing for attention. Many moving containers, ads, and animated images/clips are choppy and distracting.</p>
      <h2>Third Example of Web Page With Bad Design</h2> 
        <a href="http://www.pnwx.com/">Pacific Northwest X-Ray Inc.</a>
        <p>This website lacks effective color scheme and contrast as a result. Additionally, every bulleted link has the same image which adds to the confusion as opposed to using different images which would help the user understand what each link directs them towards. Many containers are arbitrarily placed across web pages and lack grid formatting.</p>
