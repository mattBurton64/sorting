CSC-2342 Discrete Structures (4 Credits)

This is an introductory course in discrete mathematical structures widely used computer science. The purpose of this course is to understand and use (abstract) discrete structures that are backbones of computer science. This course teaches the students techniques in how to think logically and mathematically and apply these techniques in solving problems. In particular, this class is meant to introduce logic, proofs, sets, relations, functions, counting, and probability, with an emphasis on applications in computer science. Credit Hours: Four. Prerequisite: CSC-1720 (CSC-1720 can be taken previously or concurrently with CSC-2342).
