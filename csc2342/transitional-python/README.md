# Transitional Python

This book was born out of the need to help students transition from core programming coursework in another language, chiefly C++. In my opinion, when youâ€™re coming from another language, you probably only need to be aware of where and how Python is different. That is, a long form text repeating in-common concepts, structures, and idioms is largely wasted trees. 

There are two files representing the book in this repository: the raw Markdown file and the rendered PDF. My intention is that readers use the PDF. Thus, the Markdown contains LaTeX commands necessary to format the PDF as I want the final product to appear.

Maybe *my* format doesn't work for you. That's fine. You have the Markdown at your disposal and can modify within the bounds of the license.

I use pandoc to compile:

```
pandoc transitional-python.md -o transitional-python.pdf
```
