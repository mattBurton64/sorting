# CSC2342-01 SP21 Lab Nine
## Dr. Jason M. Pittman

## Purpose
The purpose of this work is to implement a program to compute combinations or permutations.

## Requirements
Your program, at a minimum, must include the following features. Be certain to submit your assignment after you are finished programming *and* testing.

## Scenario
A physician observes a mole on a client's arm. The doctor is concerned that the mole could be cancerous, but tells the patient to be calm and that it's probably benign. Of those with skin cancer, 100% have such moles. However, 20% of those without skin cancer also have such moless. If 15% of the population has skin cancer, what's the probability that this patient has skin cancer? [](0.46875)

## Requirements
The minimum features are as follows. I recommend programming to each successive feature and testing it before moving on.

   1. You should have three variables symbolizing P(A), P(B), and P(B given A).  

   2. Calculate the conditional probability given Bayes' theorem.  

   3. Return the conditional probability as a float.

## Rubric
The grading rubric for this lab is as follows. You can construct your testing procedures based on the rubric, FYI.

   1. Does the program compile or run without error?  
   2. Does the program present me with instructions?  
   3. Does the program generate correct probability values as decimals (floats) for the stated scenario?  
   4. Does the program compute correct probability values if I change the A, B, or B given A values?
