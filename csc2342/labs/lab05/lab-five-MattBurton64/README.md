# CSC2342-01 SP21 Lab Five
## Dr. Jason M. Pittman

## Purpose
The purpose of this work is for us to evaluate the algorithmic complexity of a given *sort* function.

## Requirements
Your program, at a minimum, must include the following features. Be certain to submit your assignment after you are finished programming *and* testing.

## Features
   The minimum features are as follows. I recommend programming to each successive feature and testing it before moving on.

   1. Create a Python program `lab-5.py` which uses `import` to include the provided `Algorithm` class.
   2. Ask the user to input a list of positive integers separated by whitespace and create a `list` from the input.
   3. Instantiate an object of the provided Algorithm class named `algorithm`.  
   4. Invoke the `sort( )` method with the following `data` parameters:  
        (a) 1 2 3  
        (b) 1 2 3 4  
        (c) 1 3 5 4 2  
        (d) 1 3 5 4 2 6  
        (e) 1 3 5 4 2 6 8 7  
        (f) 1 3 15 4 2 6 8 7 10 5  
   5. Output the `sort( )` method results and your computed elapsed time for the entire sort.

## Rubric
The grading rubric for this lab is as follows. You can construct your testing procedures based on the rubric, FYI.

   1. Does the program compile or run without error?
   2. Does the program present me with instructions?
   3. Does the program include the required features?
   4. Does the program output:  
        (a) the sorting output;  
        (b) total runtime for the sort?  
   5. Does the program include comments detailing:  
        (a) your educated guess at the specific type of algorithm used in the `sort( )` method;  
        (b) your validated determination of the algorithm complexity in Big O notation;  
        (c) your history of elapsed runtimes given the required inputs?  
        (d) your system specifications (make, model, cpu type, cpu speed, ram)
