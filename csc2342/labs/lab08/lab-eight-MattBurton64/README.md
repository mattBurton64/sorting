# CSC2342-01 SP21 Lab Eight
## Dr. Jason M. Pittman

## Purpose
The purpose of this work is to implement a program to compute k-permutations.

## Requirements
Your program, at a minimum, must include the following features. Be certain to submit your assignment after you are finished programming *and* testing.

## Features
   The minimum features are as follows. I recommend programming to each successive feature and testing it before moving on.  

   1. Ask the user to input a string (e.g. *string* is a string of length six).    
     
   2. Ask the user for `k` and verify that `0 <= n <= k`.
        a. if the verification fails, ask the user for a larger `k`. Rinse and repeat until the verification passes.  

   3. Implement logic such that the program outputs the expected solution given the input to `n! / (n-k)!`   

## Rubric
The grading rubric for this lab is as follows. You can construct your testing procedures based on the rubric, FYI.

   1. Does the program include a proper program header?  
   2. Does the program compile or run without error?
   2. Does the program present me with instructions to use it?
   3. Does the program generate valid *k-permutation* ouput based on the **P(n,k)** input?
