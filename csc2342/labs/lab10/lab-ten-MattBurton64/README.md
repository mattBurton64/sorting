# CSC2342-01 SP21 Lab Ten
## Dr. Jason M. Pittman

## Purpose
The purpose of this work is to develop a program to compute the neighborhood of a given graph and vertex.

## Requirements
Your program, at a minimum, must include the following features. Be certain to submit your assignment after you are finished programming *and* testing.

## Features
I recommend programming to each successive feature and testing it before moving on.  

   1. Ask the user to input the set *V* as ordered pairs (technically, this is *E*, FYI). This way we can assume adjacencies and edges.  
       - For example: {(a,b)(a,c)(b,c)}  
   2. Ask the user to input a vertex to compute the neighborhood of *N(v)*  
   3. Output the correct neighborhood as a set of vertices.  
       - For example: N(a) = {b,c}  
       
## Rubric
The grading rubric for this lab is as follows. You can construct your testing procedures based on the rubric, FYI.  
  
   1. Does the program compile or run without error?  
   2. Does the program present me with instructions?  
   3. Does the program take the specified input(s)?  
   4. Does the program generate valid *neighborhood* given the input(s)?
